# CollaborativeDev
## Description
A simple project which has to emulate a layer of sensors detecting a particle ray and calculate the direction based on collision data
## Requirements
* We have a source of charged particles and want to measure the direction of each particle
* We have a detector 1m away from the source, consisting 5 planar sensors with a distance of 10cm and a surface area of 1x1m 
* The sensor has a resolution of 25 * 10^-6 m which gives an error length of 0.5 * 10^-4 m
